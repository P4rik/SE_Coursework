The project is a site with recipes for dishes, which will be divided into categories, such as first course, side dish, baking, etc. Information on the number of calories and the method of preparation will be provided for each dish. You will also be able to read the reviews of other users and react to them. It will be possible to search for a dish by ingredients and name, save your favorite recipes in your profile. Anyone can also add their own dish, which will appear on the website after its approval by the moderators.
During the implementation of the project, something new may appear or something that has already been announced will be changed
